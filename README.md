**PlotCraft** is an R package containing a Shiny web application designed for creating highly customizable plots comparing grouped data. It simplifies the process of visualizing both summary statistics (like means Â± SE) and the underlying distribution of individual data points, facilitating clearer communication and exploration of research findings.

This tool is particularly useful for researchers, students, and analysts who need to generate publication-quality figures comparing two groups across multiple outcomes without extensive coding.
